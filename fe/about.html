          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the School Circle App! We are dedicated to
            revolutionizing how schools manage their academic and administrative
            tasks. Our platform is designed to bring together students,
            teachers, and administrators, providing a seamless and efficient way
            to manage schedules, track subjects, and conduct online exams.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            The School Circle App was born out of a need to simplify the complex
            processes involved in managing a school. We noticed that many
            schools were struggling with outdated systems that made scheduling,
            subject tracking, and exam management a challenge. Inspired by the
            desire to create a solution that would ease these burdens, we
            developed a platform that addresses these pain points directly, with
            a focus on user-friendliness and flexibility.

            environment, where every student, teacher, and administrator thrives
            through the power of technology.
